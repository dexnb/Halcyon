LGPL-2.1 components are listed separately here so the Apache-2.0 license of the Halcyon main project is not confused with the licenses of bundled or linked third-party components.

For FFmpeg, FFmpegKit, TagLib, LyricGetter-API, SuperLyricApi, and other LGPL/MPL components, redistribution must follow the corresponding upstream license terms. If the native build configuration or bundled binaries change, this document should be updated before release.

Home daily-shuffle icon: Google Material Symbols Outlined (Apache-2.0), using the user-selected 24dp, weight 400, unfilled shuffle vector from fonts.gstatic.com.

RawS timeline port: ImmersiveWaveformProgress, ImmersiveClimaxAnalysis, PlayerTimelineGesturePolicy and RawWaveformCache, Copyright 2024–2026 RawSMusic Contributors, Apache-2.0. Halcyon supplies an independent MediaCodec PCM scanner.

RawS library pinch adaptation: LibraryPinchState uses VirtualListZoomGesturePolicy's 30-percent/500-dp-per-second release decision, endpoint velocity forwarding, and 500-ms accelerate/decelerate settling. LibraryItemMorph adapts VirtualList's retained source/target holder geometry to Halcyon's Compose cover/title/subtitle layers, preserving the focal song and existing library actions. Copyright 2024–2026 RawSMusic Contributors, Apache-2.0.

RawS cover-overlay visualizer: RawSArtworkSpectrum adapts ComposeAudioVisualizer's AlbumArtworkSpectrumOverlay (AudioVisualizerLayer.Foreground) and DisplaySpectrumMotion, plus the band mapping and rise/fall smoothing of stereo_spectrum_analyzer.cpp (MonoSpectrumAnalyzer::transform / updateSmoothedBands), to Android Visualizer FFT data, Copyright 2024–2026 RawSMusic Contributors, Apache-2.0.

ConePlayer reference: supplied v1.3.0-dev(3f88eb12f), renderer le.u, frame provider cf.c and spectrum processor se.a; the four visualizer motion models were reconstructed for Compose. No ConePlayer binaries are bundled.

Speed menu icon: Google Material Symbols Outlined, Apache-2.0, user-selected 24dp speed vector.

Comment like icon (`ic_comment_like.xml`): Google Material Icons thumb-up outline, Apache-2.0.

Lyrics motion references: user-supplied Apple Music Android decompilation (player.C.j0/q0, FullWidthAlphaGradientFlexboxLayout and lyrics dimensions) and Flamingo 1.0.0-2608212119 (t7.A0/B0/C1). The spring equations, mask geometry and motion parameters are adapted to Halcyon Compose layouts; no reference APK binaries are bundled.

## BetterLyrics visualization reference

[BetterLyrics](https://github.com/jayfunc/BetterLyrics), jayfunc and contributors, GPL-3.0,
was consulted for its centered frequency layout, smooth curve and bottom gradient behavior
(`SpectrumAnalyzer.cs` and `SpectrumRenderer.cs`, `dev` branch, 2026-09-28).
Halcyon's `CenteredSpectrum.kt` is an independent Android implementation using mixed FFT
from Android Visualizer; BetterLyrics source/binaries and its stereo WASAPI capture are not bundled.

### MusicFree plugin compatibility

Halcyon restores its own historical QuickJS compatibility layer for the [MusicFree plugin protocol](https://musicfree.catcat.work/plugin/protocol.html). Plugin names and search functions are read from plugin exports. MusicFree application binaries and plugins are not bundled; user-imported plugins retain their respective licenses. This adapter supports a subset of Node/React Native dependencies and does not imply compatibility with every plugin.

## HyperOS Super Island API

HyperNotification / Focus API, xzakota and contributors, Apache-2.0.
Halcyon directly uses `com.xzakota.hyper.notification:focus-api:1.4` for HyperOS Focus notification payloads.
Upstream: https://github.com/xzakota/HyperNotification
License: https://github.com/xzakota/HyperNotification/blob/main/LICENSE
This identifies the library's license; it does not establish the provenance of application-side integration code.
